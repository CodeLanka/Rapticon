![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://i66.tinypic.com/2ns7zn5.png)

Sprinty is a mobile application which connects you and your nearest print shop(i.e. stationary shop which have a printer). Where you can choose any type of printable document send it for printing using the app. When the printing is over you will get notified. All the chargers will be handled through the application with the ideamart CaaS API. And we will use Google maps API to locate the nearest printing shop around the customer. Customer can choose the shop. We will use a Linux web server installed apache to host over web services. 

### Why our solution is unique?
There is no any application currently for this specific task. We know that photocopy shops or print shops are always busy, when we want to take a printout it is very irritating to wait at the shop until we get our print out. Most of the people who needs photo copies are school children, obviously university students where they have less time to waste other than studying. They will love this concept. 


### Future of the application
We hope to extend the app with the camera where the user can scan a document using his camera and create a pdf file. Where all the image optimization for a readable document will be done through our app.
In few years with the client base, We hope to maintain user accounts for willing users. From this both shops & users will benefit by many ways. Also the subscribers will get a discount from shops as a promotion in 1st launch.
Feasibility



Our idea is doable since most of the print shops have internet connectivity where we install a desktop application which will get information regarding print outs. And it will communicate with the printer. Shops will have to register in our application & All the revenue will be generated by the monthly charge from the shops. App users have to register in the service to bring more assurance to app in case of fake print requests. Our app will give many information to the shop about the work done during the month. We will provide online help service in case of any errors.

### Technologies we have used: Google API, Ideamart SMS and Subscription, Android, Java Swing, Bootstrap, PHP, JQueriy, Apache, Tomcat
